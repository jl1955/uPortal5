# Downloading uPortal

You may download uPortal and use it on your site [at no cost][Apereo licensing].

## Option 1: Quickstart distribution

Just want to try out uPortal? uPortal can be downloaded pre-packaged with Apache Tomcat, Apache Ant, and Maven. This installation option is best suited for evaluation purposes only.

Quickstart releases are available from the [release pages on GitHub][uPortal releases on GitHub].

## Option 2: Clone code via Git

uPortal source is available [via GitHub](https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal).

See [instructions on the GitHub workflow][GitHub workflow]. The suggested approach to obtain the source is to fork and clone the source from GitHub into a GitHub or BitBucket account rather than downloading a tarball of the source. Cloning the github repo allows a developer to make changes to source code and a site to manage pulling updates into their local, customized fork of the source repository that has site-specific configuration updates.

## Option 3: Source distribution

Most development and production environments should be built from the uPortal source. The remainder of this manual will be helpful in learning how to configure, deploy, and develop for the uPortal platform. Pages in this installation section will provide information on basic uPortal build and deployment tasks. Downloading the source rather than forking the github source code repository is suggested only for evaluation purposes.

You can grab a tar or zip file of the source code of any release from that [release's page on GitHub][uPortal releases on GitHub].
