# Supported Browsers

## Policy

uPortal supports **the latest general audience release** and **one prior release** of these major browsers:

+   Chrome (on Android, MacOS, Windows) (including support for TalkBack)
+   Firefox (on MacOS and on Windows)
+   Safari (on MacOS and iOS) (including support for VoiceOver)
+   Internet Explorer (on Windows)
+   Edge (on Windows)

## Practice

This policy means that if there are problems with

+   using uPortal ecosystem products out of the box or
+   as typically locally implemented
+   with supported browsers

the uPortal projects are committed to accepting, triaging, and attempting to address reported issues.

Likewise, when evaluating adopting new technologies or accepting changesets, breaking support for supported browser versions is disqualifying.

uPortal ecosystem products might or might not work on other non-supported browsers or browser versions and the projects may or may not accept and prioritize issues reported as only affecting non-supported browsers or browser versions.

## Rationale

The web is getting better through better technology. uPortal wishes to take best advantage of that technology. Therefore uPortal works to support modern browsers.

uPortal supports one browser version back so that if a user always uses the latest version of a supported browser, that user will always be using a supported version, even in interims between release of a new version and the user upgrading.
