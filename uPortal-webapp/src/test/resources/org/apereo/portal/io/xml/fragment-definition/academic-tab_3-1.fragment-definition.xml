 | NOTE:  This file currently isn't used by anything.  It contains the pre-5.0
 | vales for audience (i.e. 'org.jasig.portal').  The 5-0 version of this
 | file is used in an 'identity' test -- meaning that you should get exactly the
 | same file if you import then re-export.  That's not what we would want from
 | this file.  The import process should detect and correct the package names.
 | Re-exporting should contain the new package names.  In the future, we could
 | write a test for that using this file.
